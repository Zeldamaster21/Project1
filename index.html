      <p>I currently am working as a coach/Support staff in a program called Midtown Center for boys but they are a part of 
        a non-profit organization called <b>Midtown-Metro Achivement Centers</b> Which helps students from
        the 3rd grade to 12th Grade gain virtues and help them academically! It is a wonderful program to be in
        since I have personal experience from attending this program, and it has helped me lots in the long run.
        It has helped me express myslef a lot more than I used to be, aswell as improve academically since through them
        I have gain studying techniqies that would help me, which was not easy since I have ADHD.
